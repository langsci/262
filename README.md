## Description
The standard view of the form-meaning interfaces, as embraced by the great majority
of contemporary grammatical frameworks, consists in the assumption that meaning can
be associated with grammatical form in a one-to-one correspondence. Under this view,
composition is quite straightforward, involving concatenation of form, paired with functional 
application in meaning. In this book, we will discuss linguistic phenomena across
several grammatical sub-modules (morphology, syntax, semantics) that apparently pose
a problem to the standard view, mapping out the potential for deviation from the ideal of
one-to-one correspondences, and develop formal accounts of the range of phenomena.
We will argue that a constraint-based perspective is particularly apt to accommodate
deviations from one-to-many correspondences, as it allows us to impose constraints on
full structures (such as a complete word or the interpretation of a full sentence) instead
of deriving such structures step by step.

Most of the papers in this volume will be formulated in a particular constraint-based
grammar framework, Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar. The contributions investigate 
how the lexical and constructional aspects of this theory can be combined to provide
an answer to this question across different linguistic sub-theories.
